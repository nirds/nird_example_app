This app is just a test of the emergency boardcast system... Well not really.

It is a test app used to demonstrate the capabilities of graceperiod - add a link.

The concept is that the user can see a .gif displayed on the homepage whether
or not they are signed in. They can sign in with devise and record their feelings
about a gif and then see an index of those historical feelings with the links
to the gifs.

This will allow us to have a framework for documenting "technical debt" for running
graceperiod rake tasks and ensuring that they display the right errors and operate
correctly. You should be able to run `rake` and see graceperiod failures and
warnings.
